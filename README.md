# Types-of-PowerApps-
PowerApps categorizes applications into three primary types, each serving distinct purposes and offering unique advantages: 

**Canvas Apps**: Canvas apps give you the freedom to start from a blank canvas and design the app exactly as you envision it. You control the user interface, integrating data from multiple sources using PowerAppsâ€™ wide array of formulas. 

**Practical Use Example**: Creating a task management app for your team. 

**Configuration Steps**: 

Start with a new canvas app in PowerApps. 

Design the interface with drag-and-drop elements. 

Integrate data sources, such as SharePoint or Excel. 

Add formulas to manage data interactions. 

Test and share your app with your team. 

**Model-driven Apps**: These apps automatically generate a user interface (UI) that is responsive across devices, based on the data structure you define in the Common Data Service. Model-driven apps are ideal for complex scenarios with multiple relationships between data entities. 

**Practical Use Example**: Building a customer relationship management (CRM) system. 

**Configuration Steps**: 

Define your data model in the Common Data Service. 

Use the PowerApps app designer to specify forms, views, and dashboards. 

Configure business rules and workflows. 

Publish and test your model-driven app. 

**Portal Apps**: Portal apps enable you to create external-facing websites that users outside your organization can visit to view and interact with data stored in the Common Data Service. These apps are perfect for customer service portals, community forums, or external databases. 

**Practical Use Example**: Setting up a customer service portal. 

**Configuration Steps**: 

Create a new portal app in PowerApps. 

Choose a template or start from scratch. 

Configure pages, forms, and data access. 

Set up authentication for external users. 

Publish and share the portal with users.
